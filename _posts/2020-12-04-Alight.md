## Alight: Reduce Gas Emission to Sustain the Environment
This was my first project with my own team, as project leader. We submitted this project for Imagine Cup 2010 software design category.

### Background Problem
Transportation releases an harmful gas to the air that could destroy our environment. However it is hard to cut the number of transportation significantly because it has become part of our society life. Unless we make a change in lifestyle. 
Instead of riding private car, how if most of us take the public transportation?
However, in Indonesia, the number of public transportation is insufficient and not well maintained. How to solve that?

### Proposed Solution
We created Alight, car-ride sharing app. In 2010, this solution was promising enough and disruptive. However, the lifestyle hadn't supported the system yet. As we know, in Indonesia itself, there are Gojek and Grab who have the same idea as Alight. If we were qualified enough to develop the car-ride sharing app, probably we could be one of their rival ðŸ˜„
Anyway, this idea was qualified for top 10 semi final. Unfortunately the idea was not well designed, so we failed go to the final.
