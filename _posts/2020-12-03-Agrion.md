## Agrion: Technology solution for your agricultural system
This was a submission for Software Design category in Imagine cup 2011. We presented this solution in the final of Imagine Cup Indonesia competition and got 3rd place. 

### Background Problem
The solution is to sustain food availablility in the country. Indonesia as tropical country has 2 seasons: dry season and wet season. In dry season, there is almost no rain, while in wet season, the water is overflowing. This condition affects the plantation as well. 
Farmers need to adjust their watering level, etc to let the plant survive and can harvest it in no time. 

### Proposed Solution
We created a solution that could predict the rainfall capacity and weather. Not only predict, our solution also calculate the certain of water that the plant needs. This calculation is an approved formula from agricultural researcher.
