## Getting Insight of Foreign Labours' Discrimination in Korea Using Text Mining  

### Background Problem
We want to find out whether it is true that foreign labours get discrimination in their working place due to their nationality. Other than statistic data of some variables, such as salary, we use news articles to find out another keywords why discrimination occured. 

### Data Analysis
We sampling word data from two korean newspapers: [Joongang Ilbo](https://joongang.joins.com/) and [Hankyore](http://www.hani.co.kr/). We are looking for news related to labour discrimination. 
After we got the most frequent keywords, we will analyze its relation to get insight. 
The detail of the works can be found in my github project below.
